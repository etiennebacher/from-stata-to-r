            <p>One of the greatest things about R is the possibility to easily build websites with R Shiny. I started to create apps with Shiny almost immediately after having discovered it. This was in May last year and two monts later I thought it would be a great idea to build an app to treat more easily World Bank data. Indeed, in my field, World Development Indicators (WDI) are often used and I thought it would be useful to have a graphical interface where we can import and treat these indicators.</p>

<p>So in July last year I started to work on this. Besides building something useful, I considered this as a good opportunity to practice with R Shiny. I worked on that irregularly during the rest of the year. Sometimes I considerably improved my app in a week and sometimes I spent two months not thinking about it.</p>

<p>In January, I was quite stuck: my app required to generate pieces of UI (User Interface) on the fly and I didn&rsquo;t know how to do that. But when I saw the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-contest-2020-is-here/51002">announcement</a> for the second edition of the Shiny Contest, I convinced myself to give it a try and worked a lot on my app, especially since I finally understood how to use <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html">modules</a>. Therefore, after a few weeks, I could finally deploy my app and apply to the contest. Given the incredible apps of other participants (just look at the &ldquo;Shiny Contest&rdquo; tag on <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio Community</a>), I know that there is not a chance that I win something but nonetheless I am very proud of having the possibility to show what I can do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good&rdquo;, you may say, &ldquo;but what does your app do?&rdquo;. Well if you are familiar with the WDIs, you know that each indicator has an ID (like &ldquo;NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS&rdquo;). Using this ID in my app, you can import the dataset related, choose the type of data you want (cross-country, time series, panel data), the country/countries and year(s) you want and compute the logarithm, the squared value and the lagged value of the variable. You may also generate a plot that you can download for this dataset. You can import and manipulate as many datasets as you desire and when you are done, you can merge them in a final dataset that is also downloadable. Finally, since reproducibility is a big aspect in science, all the manipulations you did are translated into R code so that you can copy and paste this code in a fresh R session and it will reproduce everything you have done. This was made possible thanks the great (but still experimental) <code>shinymeta</code> package<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Luckily-I-have-d"><a href="#fn:Luckily-I-have-d">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You can try the app <a href="https://etiennebacher.shinyapps.io/woRldbank/">here</a>, but if it has been removed by the time you go checking it, you may find the source code for the whole app <a href="https://github.com/etiennebacher/woRldbank">on GitHub</a>.</p>
