      <description>I am a French student doing a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in economics and I&amp;rsquo;m sick of learning Stata to do econometrics. I love R and its flexibility and I think that students in university should learn R. However, R has a steeper learning curve than Stata. Therefore, this blog aims to facilitate the transition from Stata to R for students in economics. The content you can find on it may help students or professionals in other domains but the topics will be focused on economics.</description>

      <description>Before going into the details about studying economics with R, it makes sense to explain why you should use R compared to Stata. Before I start, please note that I have been using Stata occasionally for about a year whereas I spend much more time on R so I may forget some features that Stata has and that I am not aware of. However, I believe that what I have made with Stata corresponds to most Master studentsâ€™ experiences, e.</description>
