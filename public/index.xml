      <description>In this post, you will see how to import and treat data, make descriptive statistics and a few plots. I will also show you a personal method to organize one&amp;rsquo;s work.
Files used and organization of the project First of all, you need to create a project. In RStudio, you can do &amp;ldquo;File&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;New Project&amp;rdquo; and then choose the location of the project and its name. In the folder that contains the project, I have several sub-folders: Figures, Bases_Used, Bases_Created.</description>
