      <description>Note:  In this and future articles, you will see some arrows below R code. In you click on it, it will display the Stata code equivalent to the R code displayed. However, since those are two different softwares, they are not completely equivalent and some of the Stata code may not fully correspond to the R code. Consider it more like a reference point not to be lost rather than like an exact equivalent.</description>

However, R has a steeper learning curve than Stata. Therefore, this blog aims to facilitate the transition from Stata to R for students in economics. The content you can find on it may help students or professionals in other domains but the topics will be focused on economics.</description>
