I am a French student doing a Master's degree in economics. I love R and its flexibility and I think that students in university should learn R. However, R has a steeper learning curve than Stata. Therefore, this blog aims to facilitate the transition from Stata to R for students in economics. The content you can find on it may help students or professionals in other domains but the topics will be focused on economics.
