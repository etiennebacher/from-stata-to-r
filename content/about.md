I am a French student doing a Master's degree in economics and I'm sick of learning Stata to do econometrics. I love R and its flexibility and I think that students in university should learn R. However, R has a learning curve which is steeper than Stata's. Therefore, this blog aims to facilitate the transition from Stata to R for students in economics. The content you can find on it may help students or professionals in other domains but the topics will be focused on economics.
